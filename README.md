# FengShui
Interior/exterior home design tool that reads space and caculates dimensions for the best fit for furniture in areas of rooms and areas.

UPDATE

Added new code that asks users for areas of rooms. this allows users to input the length and width of rooms to calculate the rooms area and how much space is available.

UPDATE

added new code that can ask users for areas of non square rooms (still needs to apply to more areas but is in wip). Added this function becsuse not every room in houses are square or recatangular, this allows most rooms to be looked at however we want to make it accessible to any shapes of rooms.

UPDATE

Added a function that allows users to see if items are too big for the room, need to ad a function that allows the code to add multiple areas of items instead of just one. This one one of the other main functions to add so we can see what size of furniture can be added in rooms to first see if it fits, then later on an additonal function to show how much space is left.
